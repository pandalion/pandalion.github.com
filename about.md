The pandalion aka Panda is a 30-something (she's losing count) front-end developer from the UK. It's kind of funny how we define ourselves by our job title isn't it? Panda is lots of things. She certainly loves coding, especially writing [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), working in teams (she's no rockstar), mentoring junior developers and creating awesome stuff, but she also loves:
- videogames (she started with the C64 and hasn't looked back)
- drawing cute things (see some on facebook at [Pandalion Doodles](https://www.facebook.com/pandaliondoodles/))
- hanging out with her partner and their cat baby
- eating at restaurants
- listening to pop-punk music from the 90s (her favourite band are still blink-182)
- riding on steam trains
- having cosy feet (who doesn't though?)

Panda is currently part of the awesome Open Digital team @ [Open Health](https://www.openhealth.co.uk/).
