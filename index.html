                <p>And as soon as I've written this I am putting this page, at least as a html/css design ONLINE, to sort of uh, finalise it. Reason being - I think I started working/planning to create this blog in.. October 2011? That's like.. 4 months ago :s</p>

                <p>What have I done in that time? Designed it four or five times. Partially built two of those designs. Had a go at setting up a blog app with django. Procrastinated. I did start writing my blog over at blogspot at least, so that was good as I've got into writing about stuff now, and I really like it.</p>

                    <figcaption>Some of my previous designs that I hated a week later XD</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>But, I'm the sorta person that really wants to do it all from scratch - even if some of that is tricky ;) And I guess that's why it's taking me so long. So, tonight I decided, I'm designing <em>something</em>, building it, and keeping it simple enough that I don't get overwhelmed. The design is the thing I really don't wanna spend forever on, but also something I can never help getting all perfectionistic over.</p>

                <p>Obviously my blog is not done. I wrote this in my text editor for now, and I'll stick the page up on my webfaction hosting, just to tell myself - the <em>design</em> is done (for now) - move on! No more design procrastination.</p>

                <p>I'm sure the design will evolve - but for now I want to focus on being able to use this blog instead of blogspot. So hooking it up with django is really what I want to figure out next. I've not yet succeeded in figuring out the management of static files within a django app so.. yeah. I just want to know that so I can confidently understand how to build a dynamic site (which I haven't done on my own since I used to write asp and php yeeears ago). And uhh, I'd definately like to be able to use something other than those ;)</p>

                <p>After that I want to focus on making it more responsive, and well.. the million things I want to learn really, but.. gotta keep the momentum up!</p>

                <p>Let me know what you think on twitter @thepandalion - I'd love to hear your opinions on the design:)</p>
